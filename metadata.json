  "description": "Makes Gnome's onscreen keyboard more useable with e.g. more keys. This extension is based on https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1631/improve-onscreen-keyboard/ but this version will make the keyboard appear on the top layer of the gnome shell. The most of the coding was done by schuhumi@extensions.gnome.org. Since there was no way of contacting him and i also didnt find any git repo for the extension i decided to publish it here.",
